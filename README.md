# Graph Traversal and Search Algorithm Visualizer

## Introduction
This project aims to develop a program for visualizing various **graph traversal** and **search algorithms**. These algorithms are fundamental in computer science and are widely used in applications such as **pathfinding, network routing, and artificial intelligence**. By providing an interactive platform, users can better understand the behavior and performance of different algorithms when traversing graphs.

## Existing System
While there are existing tools for visualizing graph algorithms, many lack **user-friendly interfaces** or fail to provide comprehensive support for a wide range of algorithms.

## Proposed Solution
This project implements several key graph traversal and search algorithms, including:

- **A-star Algorithm**
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
- **Depth-Limited Search**
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**
- **Greedy Best-First Search**
- **Uniform Cost Search**

## Salient Features
- ✅ Users can **input graphs** (nodes and edges).
- ✅ Select from a list of **graph traversal algorithms**.
- ✅ **Step-by-step visualization** of the traversal process.
- ✅ **Display results** for each algorithm.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Operating System:** Cross-platform (Linux, Windows)
